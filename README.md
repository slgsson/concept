DRAFT CONCEPT
=============
With creation at its very core, Berlin is a constant source of inspiration for the new and the
changing - a nurturing place for the process of innovative and alternative ecosystems. The
culture room for EthBerlin seeks to reflect and present a city that always has been, and still
is, in flux and transient, a city that thrives on its movements.
With is constant yearning for movement, Berlin has become a city in the forefront of
alternative ecosystems, nurturing not only the new systems themselves, but also the makers
of them. With so many alternative systems developing, the whole construction of Berlin has
a feeling of being unrestrained, just like it’s nature and it’ parks. It aspires to the wild and the
unkept, giving a sense of not being able to stifle the natural growth.
With old systems in place, all new beginnings start from a clean slate, allowing for it to grow
with a process in mind. A lot of this is echoed in the nature on Berlin. With its season the
growth starts from fresh every spring, bringing a sense of newness, fresh opportunities and
inspiration.
The culture room at EthBerlin will be a place of inspiration, different perspectives and new
beginnings, allowing for the creative to be unrestrained. It’s there to allow the participants a
break and to gather new ideas in a cultural environment seeking to portray the exciting and
unkept nature of the city itself.
